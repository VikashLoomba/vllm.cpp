"""Feature code reaches main only through a reviewed row/* PR. (W1)

This is how "the operator drives features only via sub-agents" is enforced. It
deliberately does NOT try to detect who typed the code -- authorship is
self-asserted and unprovable. It enforces the PATH instead: feature code arrives
on `main` through a merged `row/<ROW-ID>` PR, whoever produced it. A sub-agent, a
helper session, or the developer all satisfy it the same way, and a direct push
of feature code does not.

Non-product paths are classified by closed lexical forms rather than exempting
whole mutable trees.  This checker still owns the feature-arrival rule; the PR
and size gates independently review the other classes.

ACTIVATION. ENFORCING since the cutover commit 44e8225cf (user-directed
2026-08-05). Every commit from that one ONWARD must land feature code through a
merged `row/*` PR; everything before it is exempt, because it was created under
the previous direct-push policy and rewriting that judgement retroactively would
redden honest history. The cutover itself is a records-only commit, so it passes.

What this changes in practice: feature paths (src/, include/, tests/, examples/,
cmake/, CMakeLists.txt) can no longer be pushed straight to main. Integration
paths (scripts/, .agents/, docs/, .github/) still can, deliberately, so the
operator can fix a gate or repair the record without a round trip.
