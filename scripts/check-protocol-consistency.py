"""Keep structured policy consumers and their protocol artifacts consistent.

Public-document obligations are controlled policy rows. The document checker
fully parses their stable ID, exact scope, semantic trigger, positive action,
and enforcement list; explanatory details remain in procedures.

The same gate now also asserts that `.agents/workflow.md` carries the ROLE
INTERVIEW, between `<!-- role-interview:begin -->` and its `:end`. That is the
same failure with the polarity flipped: agent-preflight.sh refuses a session
that has not declared a role, so an agent who is never told the question, or
never told that `read-only` is one of the answers, meets a red gate with no
instructions -- and a gate people cannot satisfy is a gate people route around.

The same gate also asserts that `.agents/workflow.md` carries the ORCHESTRATION
LOOP, between `<!-- orchestration-loop:begin -->` and its `:end`. The prompts
below are what a sub-agent is handed; the loop is what the OPERATOR does with
them, and until it was written here it lived nowhere an agent reads -- neither
`AGENTS.md` nor this manual said that a reviewer must mutate rather than read,
that the controller runs the row's gate itself instead of taking the
implementer's word, or that findings are never fixed in the controller's own
session.

The same gate finally runs the closed runtime-prompt grammar. Phrase presence
cannot establish a method contract: contradictory prose may retain every
required phrase. The semantic validator therefore parses every nonempty line.
