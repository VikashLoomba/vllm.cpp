"""Declare, materialize and re-derive an agent session's role. (W0)

The role CANNOT be derived at session start: the common case is one operator and
several helpers all launched from the SAME checkout, indistinguishable until a
role has already been taken. So the role is DECLARED, immediately MATERIALIZED
into a fact, and only then re-derived. See
.agents/specs/operator-helper-protocol.md.

A role keys on the **worktree**, never on the session (user-directed correction,
2026-08-06):

* **worktree** - `git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir`, which is per-worktree
  (`.git/worktrees/<name>`), so a materialized helper is distinguishable from
  the primary checkout without any bookkeeping. The marker lives inside it, so
  one worktree is one role and that role survives a new shell, a new process
  and a lost environment.
* **session** - `VLLM_CPP_AGENT_SESSION` when set, else the parent process id.
  Recorded as PROVENANCE only, and nothing gates on it. An earlier version of
  this file called it "stable across tool calls within a session (measured)".
  That was DISPROVEN: at least one real harness gives every tool call a fresh
  shell and does not persist environment variables, so a role claimed in one
  call resolved as UNDECLARED in the next and `agent-preflight.sh` exited 1 --
  making a default-on role gate unpassable rather than strict, which is how a
  gate teaches people to disable it.

The accepted cost is explicit: two sessions sharing one checkout share a role.
Helpers take their own worktree by construction, so the shared case is the
operator's primary checkout, where one role is the correct answer anyway. See
.agents/specs/session-onboarding.md, "Correction: a role keys on the WORKTREE,
not the session".

The operator lock lives in the git COMMON dir, not the working tree: it is
shared by every worktree of the repo (the correct scope for "one operator per
repo") and can never be committed by accident. Its ownership keys on the
worktree too, so the operator survives the same call boundary while a second
worktree is still refused.
